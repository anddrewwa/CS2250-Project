                <td>This was the movie that my guitar teacher had put on during my senior year of highschool. 
                    Before this I had seen some clips and stuff from this movie, but never fully watched it. 
                    Oh boy do I regret not watching it sooner, this movie is sooo much better than I had expeted it to be. 
                    You would think this is a movie that for the female gaze, but to my surprise it captured my gaze too. 
                    I think I just enjoy watching drama.

                <td>First seen this movie during my film class my first year here in Cal Poly Pomona. I didn't expect this
                    movie to be so enjoyable. This was definitely my favorite movie I watched during that class. Super funny
                    and the two leads had amazing chemistry.

                <td>Watched this movie a few years back with my friend. Sooo enjoyable. We just picked a random movie we saw off
                    imdb and we loved this movie so much. The dynamics between the two leads are soo funny and interesting. It was awesome 
                    to see how Dr.Shirley had changed Tony for the better.

                <td>This movie was going so viral and everyone was talking about it when it first came out in 2021. However, I had mostly
                    ignored most of the people's talk about it and never really thought about it. That's until about a year ago when the second 
                    movie came out and I started to see people talk about it again. So finally a few months I decided to give it a try 
                    and it's soooooooooo good. I actually kind of glad I didn't watch part 1 back in 2021 because I could not have waited 3 years
                    for the second part.
