        <p> Hello my name is Andrew Chen. I am currently a student at Cal Poly Pomona, studying Computer Science.
            Some little fun facts about is that I went to Japan this summer, huge achievement for me because 
            I haven't left the United States in like 18 years. Something else I consider as an achievement was that
            I also finished reading my first ever book this summer! Well a book that I read on my own volition and 
            not because it was required by school or whatnot. I'm actually going to be talking about this book in my 
            book page so be sure to check that out if you're interested. I also have a page where I review some of the
            movies I have watched, not all of them of course because that would be too much, so I picked so of the most
            memorable ones. 
        </p>
