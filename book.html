        <h3>Why I enjoyed it</h3>
        <!-- Requirement-1.I -->
        <p> Project Hail Mary is the one and only book that I ever read voluntarily, and I have to say it is the best book I've read so far.
            The wild ride and journey this book has taken me is something I did not expect when I first picked it up. So for those who do not know
            Project Hail Mary is a science-fiction book where humanity and every life on Earth is on the verge of extinction. To stop this crisis,
            a single lone scienctist is launched to space to figure out what is wrong. A movie just got announced for this book, set to release in 
            2026, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m08TxIsFTRI">trailer</a> if you haven't already.

            <summary>Spoilers</summary>
            In case you want to read the book yourself, I have a little spoiler block so I can talk freely without having to spoil any detials.
            When I first read the book I think I was a bit confused on the direction it was going to go, and actually hesitant on whether I would enjoy it or not.
            This book actually took me over a few months to read because the beginning of the book was a dragging a tiny bit and I wasn't really too hooked. It does 
            have a lot of physics and science detials that I don't know if they're realistic or not. If you're a physics-head, someone that enjoys all the physics details 
            like gravity, centripetal force, time dilation stuff, then you will really enjoy this book. What really got me hooked on to this book was right in the middle of
            the book where they introduces a new character. Up to this point of the book, our main character is essentially alone trying to save the earth from dying, which I 
            forgot to mention but it's this red alien, pathogen like creature that is sucking the sun's energy away which means that sun will die in a few years if left alone.
            Anyways, he is alone when all of the sudden he meets an alien speices! This is when I really started to lock in and pay attention to this book, because it gets crazy good. 
            I think from a reader's standpoint, stories like these get more interesting when there's else that the character can interact with and bounce off with. Like the interactions
            these two had just made the book a hundred times more interesting. The ending of the book was also bittersweet, and not something I expected at all. I knew something was
            wrong when they solved the problem, but the book still had like 30 pages left. 10/10 book. Would read again.

            <p> Huge thanks to whoever suggested this book, which I think I read off some youtube comment, because this book is amazing. 
            Definitely realized that books are pretty fun to read, will read more books in the future. Maybe you can recommend <a href="mailto:andrewzchen@cpp.edu">me</a> some.</p>
